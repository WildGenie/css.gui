# Theming

<FirstParagraph>

Use a theme to collapse the space for your controls.

</FirstParagraph>

When you pass in a theme to your editor, a theme unit will show up for any
inputs that have a corresponding collection of theme values. Users still have
the ability to "eject" from those theme values, but we constrain to them by
default.

CSS GUI supports two different theme formats:

- [**System UI**](https://system-ui.com/theme): A theme specification used by
  tools including Theme UI, Chakra UI, and Stitches.
- [**Theme Schema**](/guides/theme-schema): A uuid-based theme shape used by
  the [Components AI Theme Builder](https://components.ai/theme) which lets
  use visually create a theme.

## Using the System UI Theme Specification

If you have a theme object that you're using in a containing app, or even one
created by a user, you can transform that object into the _Theme Schema_.

```js
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Editor, styled, importTheme } from '@compai/css-gui'

const theme = importTheme({
  colors: {
    gray: ['#111', '#888', '#ccc'],
    tomato: 'tomato',
  },
  space: [0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256],
  fontSizes: [12, 14, 16, 24, 32, 64, 128],
})

const MyEditor = () => {
  const [styles, setStyles] = useState({})

  return (
    <>
      <Editor styles={styles} onChange={setStyles} theme={theme}>
        <Inputs.Color />
      </Editor>
      <styled.p styles={styles}>Hello, world!</styled.p>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Supported Theme Properties

- Colors
- Font Sizes
- Line Heights
- Space
- Border Widths
- Border Radii

In the near future you can expect more theme property support
and improved parsing.

## Theme Schema

If you already have a theme schema from the [Components AI Theme Builder](https://components.theme),
you can export the _"JSON (Raw Schema)"_ format, then cut and paste it into your app.
