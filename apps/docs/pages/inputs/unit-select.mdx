import { FirstParagraph } from '../../components/FirstParagraph'

# Unit Select

<FirstParagraph>A unit select derived from CSS properties.</FirstParagraph>

This component is primarily used internally, for handling inputs that have different
units that can be used like the [`LengthInput`](/components/length). However, it's
also provided as a public API so you can build your own custom inputs through
composition.

## Usage

```js
import { UnitSelect, Unit } from 'css-gui'

const Component = () => {
  const [unit, setUnit] = useState<Unit>('px')

  return (
    <UnitSelect property="fontSize" value={unit} onChange={setUnit}>
  )
}
```
