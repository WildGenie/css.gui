# Introduction

<FirstParagraph>
  An open-source, visual development environment for CSS. Built in React with
  themeability and extensibility in mind.

With CSS GUI you can quickly get up and running with parametric controls for styling.
You can use this to improve your creative coding workflow or build user interfaces
where users get to control how their content looks.

At its essence, CSS GUI exposes an `Editor` and a `RenderElement` component to display
your controls and canvas, respectively.

```js
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Editor, RenderElement } from '@compai/css-gui'

export const MyEditor = () => {
  const [styles, setStyles] = useState({})

  return (
    <>
      <Editor styles={styles} onChange={setStyles} />
      <RenderElement tagName="p" styles={styles}>
        Hello, world!
      </RenderElement>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Theme units

Define a theme and use that to collapse the space for the controls.
Controls still allow you to put in any custom value, but will default
to the values in your theme for rapid designing and consistency.

## Media query support

Change your designs across viewports with CSS controls that understand
media queries. CSS GUI controls let you seamlessly switch back and forth
between all viewports and responsive values.

You can also customize your breakpoints in your theme. Whether it's only two
breakpoints or eight, you decide.

## Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are actively being worked on to unlock
all the functionality that CSS offers. You'll be able to change the color
of a visited link or create a popover caret with `.some-element::before`.

## Fully-typed API

By leveraging [`csstype`](https://github.com/frenic/csstype), we are able to
expose a fully-typed API (under development) which helps you avoid pesky bugs
and ensures all CSS declarations are valid.
