# Theme Schema

The _"Theme Schema"_ is a more robust and granular version of a standard
[System UI Theme](https://system-ui.com/theme).

This is by design, because CSS GUI needs to be able to refer to theme values
via their UUID to properly handle aliasing. Additionally, length units are
automatically unpacked into [`CSSUnitValue`s](/guides/css-unit-value) so
that there isn't a need to make multiple parsing passes.
